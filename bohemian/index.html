              <h2>
                The Bohemian Brands creates a culture of mindful living, through
                creative partnerships. We speak fluently in the tongue of the
                nomad and work with artisans to bring our visions to reality.
              </h2>
              <h2>
                Each brand centers around a form of self-care. From sharing the
                best dishes by our favorite chefs, to partnering with artisans
                to design global goods, our aim is to curate aspirational spaces
                for timeless moments.
              </h2>
              <h2>
                We are here to give you a roadmap to becoming a global citizen.
                We live the belief of Robert Louis Stevenson, that “There are no
                foreign lands, it is only the traveler that is foreign.” We
                invite you to explore each of our brands and bask in the moments
                that resonate with you the most.

            <h1>VANESSA + MORGAN</h1>
            <h2>
              Best friends first and business partners second, Vanessa Coore
              Vernon and Morgan Ashley came together fusing their separate
              ventures to create The Bohemian Brands.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Vanessa, a Global Collaborator started Bazaar Bohemian in 2013 as
              a personal social media page. Over time it grew into a way to show
              appreciation for artisans and experiences she encountered on her
              travels around the world. This opened doors to finding her tribe
              with every new passport stamp. As it developed organically the
              importance of representation reinforced the fire to grow this
              initiative on a larger scale.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Born and raised in Oakland, Morgan Ashley’s nomadic spirit led her
              to Atlanta and into alignment with her current role as Director of
              PR and Operations for The Bohemian Brands. Destined to be anything
              but ordinary, Morgan’s uncompromising, unapologetic pride in her
              blackness and queerness guide her as an entrepreneur and cultural
              purveyor. A connoisseur of culture, style, and cuisine, Morgan
              relied on these core tenets during her earliest days as an
              influencer and entrepreneur, launching the food discovery brand,
              EatHereATL. It was also during this period of growth and discovery
              that she connected with business partner Vanessa Coore Vernon and
              conceived The Bohemian Brands, a joint venture created to rewrite
              the narrative behind the bohemian lifestyle and shed light on the
              intersectionality of social institutions such as race, sexuality,
              and gender. For Morgan, being Black is more than an identity; it
              is manna from heaven.

              Collectively their journey has magnified the need for
              intersectional spaces striving for a greater good. Become part of
              the journey by following The Bohemian Brands and learning more
              about each one and how you can contribute to the vision.
